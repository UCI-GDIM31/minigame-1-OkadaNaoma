## Devlog
In a battle-royale game, Components are small abilities or settings. Think of a suppressor that makes shots quiet, a grappling hook that lets you climb, sprint to move faster, or a medkit to heal. Each one does a simple job and changes how something behaves.
GameObjects are the things in the game: a player, a drone, a loot chest, a car. A GameObject is shaped by the Components it has. A Scene is the whole match: the island map, the weather, the shrinking circle, supply drops, and the rules. When many GameObjects enter the Scene, their Components interact, and that is what makes each round feel new.
